# ComputerVisionMathable

Overview
This project was developed for my CAVA course. It is a computer vision program designed to recognize and process different states of the game board for Mathable, a math-based tabletop game.

Features

Number Recognition: Detects and identifies the numbers on the game board.
Position Mapping: Determines the exact positions of the numbers on the board grid.
Score Calculation: Automatically calculates each player's score based on the board state.
The program utilizes computer vision techniques to analyze images of the Mathable board and extract meaningful data to enhance gameplay and scoring accuracy.

Technologies Used

Python -> Numpy and Opencv

Running instructions:
To run the project after cloning it, you need to edit the PATH global variable inside main.py. Inside the PATH directory the application expects to find every boardstate of the game as a .jpg image (1_01.jpg)
